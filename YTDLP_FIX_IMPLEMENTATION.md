# TikTok URL Download Fix Implementation

## Status
âœ… **Fixed**: The yt-dlp binary path issue has been resolved. The binary is now correctly located and executed.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated Import in `/app/api/download-video/route.ts`**:
   - Changed from default import to using the `create` function from `yt-dlp-exec`
   - Added dynamic path resolution to find yt-dlp binary in multiple locations

2. **Created Setup Script**:
   - Created `/scripts/setup-ytdlp.js` to ensure yt-dlp binary is properly set up
   - Script copies binary to `/bin/yt-dlp` for consistent access
   - Added to `postinstall` script in `package.json`

3. **Added Path Resolution Logic**:
   - Checks multiple possible locations for yt-dlp binary
   - Falls back gracefully if binary not found in expected location
   - Logs the binary path for debugging

## Current Issue
The TikTok video download is now failing with a format error rather than the binary not found error. This is a different issue related to TikTok's video protection mechanisms.

## Next Steps
To fully enable TikTok video downloads, you may need to:

1. **Update yt-dlp**: The binary might be outdated. Run:
   ```bash
   cd node_modules/yt-dlp-exec
   npm run postinstall
   ```

2. **Use cookies for authentication**: TikTok often requires authentication. You can add cookie support to the download function.

3. **Try alternative extractors**: Sometimes using different options helps:
   ```javascript
   await ytdl(url, {
     output: outputPath,
     format: 'best',
     cookies: '/path/to/cookies.txt',  // If you have TikTok cookies
     extractor-args: 'tiktok:api_hostname=api16-normal-c-useast1a.tiktokv.com',
     // Other options...
   })
   ```

## Testing
To test the implementation:
1. Make sure the server is running: `npm run dev`
2. Try pasting a TikTok URL in the chat
3. Check the console logs for debug information

The binary path issue is now resolved, and the system is attempting to download videos correctly.
