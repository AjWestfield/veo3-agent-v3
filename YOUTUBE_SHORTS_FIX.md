# YouTube Shorts Fix Summary

## Problem
YouTube Shorts URLs were not being detected and downloaded, while regular YouTube videos worked fine.

## Root Cause
The URL detection regex pattern in `detectVideoUrls()` function (app/page.tsx) didn't include the `/shorts/` path pattern used by YouTube Shorts.

## Solution
Updated the regex pattern to include YouTube Shorts URLs:

### Before:
```javascript
youtube\.com\/watch\?v=|youtu\.be\/
```

### After:
```javascript
youtube\.com\/(?:watch\?v=|shorts\/)|youtu\.be\/
```

This pattern now matches:
- ✅ Regular YouTube: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID`
- ✅ YouTube Shorts: `https://www.youtube.com/shorts/VIDEO_ID`
- ✅ Short URLs: `https://youtu.be/VIDEO_ID`

## Technical Details

The fix uses a non-capturing group `(?:...)` to match either:
- `watch?v=` (regular videos)
- `shorts/` (YouTube Shorts)

## No Backend Changes Needed
- The backend already correctly identifies Shorts URLs as YouTube platform
- yt-dlp already supports downloading YouTube Shorts
- Only the frontend URL detection needed updating

## Testing

Run the test script:
```bash
node test-youtube-shorts.js
```

Or manually test by pasting these URLs in the app:
- Regular: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`
- Shorts: `https://www.youtube.com/shorts/tDukIfFzX18`

Both should now download successfully!

## Verification Steps
1. Open the app at http://localhost:3000
2. Paste a YouTube Shorts URL
3. Video should download and appear in chat/sidebar
4. Check console logs for successful detection
