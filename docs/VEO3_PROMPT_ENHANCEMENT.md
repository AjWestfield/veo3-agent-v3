## Usage Benefits

### For Video Recreation:
1. **Precise Replication**: Every detail needed to recreate the exact shot
2. **Technical Accuracy**: Camera settings and movements documented
3. **Visual Consistency**: Color, lighting, and composition preserved
4. **Motion Matching**: Exact timing and movement patterns captured

### For AI Understanding:
1. **Comprehensive Context**: AI receives complete scene understanding
2. **Nuanced Details**: Subtle elements that define the shot
3. **Clear Instructions**: Structured format prevents ambiguity
4. **Quality Control**: Negative prompts prevent unwanted elements

## Example Comparison

### Old Template Output:
```
CLIP: Person walks through park.
STYLE: 8K cinematic, natural lighting.
VISUAL_DESCRIPTION: A person in casual clothes walks through a green park.
```

### New Template Output:
```
CLIP: A young woman in her mid-20s gracefully strides through a sun-dappled urban park, her floral summer dress flowing with each step as she glances at her phone, creating a narrative of modern life intersecting with nature.

STYLE: 8K cinematic documentary style reminiscent of Terrence Malick, warm color grading with golden hour tones, shallow depth of field creating dreamy bokeh, handheld camera work adding intimate realism.

TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATIONS:
- Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1 anamorphic
- Frame Rate: 24fps cinematic
- Depth of Field: Shallow (f/1.8 estimated)
- Shutter Speed Effect: 180Â° shutter, natural motion blur
- ISO/Grain: Clean, minimal grain
- Lens Type: 85mm portrait lens

COLOR_PALETTE:
- Primary Colors: Warm amber (#FFB366), sage green (#87A96B)
- Secondary Colors: Soft pink (#FFD1DC), earth brown (#8B4513)
- Color Temperature: 4500K golden hour warmth
- Color Contrast: Complementary warm/cool balance
```

## Implementation Details

### File Structure:
