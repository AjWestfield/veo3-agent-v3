# Drag and Drop Fixed! ‚úÖ

## The Issue
The drag and drop wasn't working because I was updating the wrong component. The `chatgpt-prompt-input.tsx` component has drag and drop implemented, but your main `page.tsx` uses its own custom chat interface implementation.

## What I Fixed
I've now added complete drag and drop functionality directly to your main chat interface in `page.tsx`:

### 1. Added State Management
- Added `isDragOver` state to track when files are being dragged

### 2. Implemented Event Handlers
- `handleDragEnter` - Triggers when dragging enters the chat input
- `handleDragOver` - Maintains drag state while hovering
- `handleDragLeave` - Clears state when leaving the drop zone
- `handleDrop` - Processes dropped files using existing `handleFileChange`

### 3. Visual Feedback
- Blue border and slight scale effect when dragging
- Overlay with "Drop files here" message
- Smooth transitions for better UX

### 4. Debug Logging
Added console.log statements to help debug:
- `[DragEnter]` - When entering drop zone
- `[DragLeave]` - When leaving drop zone  
- `[Drop]` - When files are dropped (shows file details)

## How to Test
1. Restart your development server
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Drag an image/video/audio file over the chat input
4. You should see:
   - Blue overlay with "Drop files here"
   - Console logs showing drag events
   - Files appear as thumbnails after dropping

## Supported Files
- üñºÔ∏è Images (up to 20MB)
- üé• Videos (up to 1GB)
- üéµ Audio files (up to 20MB)

The drag and drop now works exactly like clicking the "+" button to select files!
