# Video Generation Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Prompt Length Limit (âœ… Fixed)
- **Problem**: Video generation was failing with "Prompt is too long. Maximum 2000 characters allowed."
- **Solution**: Increased the limit from 2000 to 5000 characters to accommodate complex video prompts

### 2. Video Placeholder Not Showing (âœ… Fixed)
- **Problem**: The video generation placeholder animation wasn't displaying during video generation
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed the video generation flag management to not reset when streaming starts
  - Video placeholder now shows during the actual generation process

### 3. Streaming Progress Updates (âœ… Fixed)
- **Problem**: Users saw nothing during the 45-90 second video generation process
- **Solution**: 
  - Created a new streaming video generation endpoint `/api/generate-video/stream`
  - Implemented real-time progress updates during video generation
  - Progress messages show initialization, processing, and completion stages

### 4. Video Display in Sidebar (âœ… Fixed)
- **Problem**: Generated videos weren't appearing in the sidebar
- **Solution**: 
  - Added proper video event handling in the streaming response
  - Videos are now automatically added to the sidebar when generation completes

## How It Works Now:

1. **User selects "Generate video" tool and enters prompt**
2. **Video placeholder animation shows immediately** with:
   - Model information (VEO 3 Fast or Kling 2.1)
   - Progress bar
   - Status messages
3. **Real-time progress updates** during generation:
   - "ðŸŽ¬ Starting video generation..."
   - "ðŸ“¹ Processing video with [Model]..."
   - "âœ¨ Video generation complete!"
4. **Video appears in chat** with play controls
5. **Video is added to sidebar** for easy access

## Testing Instructions:

1. **Restart the development server** to apply all changes
2. **Test with a simple prompt**:
   - Select "Generate video" tool
   - Enter: "A peaceful sunset over the ocean with gentle waves"
   - Watch for the placeholder animation
   - Verify progress updates appear
   - Confirm video plays when ready
   - Check that video appears in sidebar

3. **Test with your complex prompt** (the one that was failing):
   - Should now work without the length error
   - Progress should be visible throughout generation

## What to Expect:

- **VEO 3 Fast**: ~45-60 seconds generation time
- **Kling 2.1**: ~60-90 seconds generation time
- Progress updates every second during generation
- Automatic retry on transient errors (502/503)
- Clear error messages if something goes wrong

## Notes:

- Video generation requires a valid Replicate API token
- Ensure you have sufficient API quota
- The placeholder will show throughout the entire generation process
- Videos are automatically looped and muted when displayed
