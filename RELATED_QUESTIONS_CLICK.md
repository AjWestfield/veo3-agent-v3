# Related Questions Click Implementation - July 16, 2025

## Feature Implemented

Made the "People Also Ask" questions clickable to automatically trigger a new web search.

## Changes Made

### 1. WebSearchResults Component (`/components/web-search-results.tsx`)
- Added `onRelatedQuestionClick` prop to interface
- Added onClick handler to each question item
- Questions now trigger callback when clicked

### 2. MessageContent Component (`/components/ui/message-content.tsx`)
- Added `onRelatedQuestionClick` prop to interface
- Updated function signature to accept the new prop
- Passed the prop through to WebSearchResults component

### 3. Main Page Component (`/app/page.tsx`)
- Created `handleRelatedQuestionClick` function that:
  - Sets selectedTool to 'searchWeb'
  - Sets the clicked question as the message
  - Programmatically submits the form after a short delay
  - Scrolls to bottom to show new search
- Passed the handler to MessageContent component

## How It Works

1. User clicks on any question in "People Also Ask" section
2. The question text is automatically set as the search query
3. Web search tool is automatically selected
4. Form is submitted programmatically
5. New search begins with the selected question
6. Page scrolls to show the new search results

## Technical Details

- Used setTimeout with 100ms delay to ensure state updates complete before submission
- Created synthetic form event to call handleSubmit
- Added scrollToBottom() to ensure new search is visible
- Maintains existing hover effects and styling

## User Experience

- Single click on any related question triggers immediate search
- No need to copy/paste or manually type the question
- Seamless continuation of research flow
- Visual feedback with hover effects maintained
