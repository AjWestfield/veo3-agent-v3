# Sample Audio Files

This directory is for storing sample audio files for testing the audio analysis feature.

## Supported Formats
- MP3 (.mp3)
- WAV (.wav)
- OGG (.ogg)
- M4A (.m4a)

## Adding Test Audio Files
1. Place your audio files in this directory
2. Keep files under 20MB for optimal performance
3. Use descriptive filenames (e.g., "conversation-sample.mp3", "music-with-speech.wav")

## Test Scenarios
Consider adding audio files that test:
- Single speaker monologue
- Multi-speaker conversations
- Different emotions/tones (happy, sad, angry, excited)
- Background music or noise
- Different languages
- Various audio qualities

## Note
Sample audio files are not included in the repository to keep the size manageable. Add your own test files locally.
