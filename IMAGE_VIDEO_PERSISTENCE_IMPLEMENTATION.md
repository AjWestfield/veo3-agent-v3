# Image and Video Persistence Implementation

## Summary

I've successfully implemented persistent storage for images and videos in the sidebar using IndexedDB instead of localStorage. Here's what was done:

### 1. Created IndexedDB Storage System (`/lib/media-storage.ts`)
- Replaces localStorage for better storage capacity
- Handles base64 data without size limitations
- Supports images, videos, and audio
- Includes migration from existing localStorage data

### 2. Updated Images Context (`/contexts/images-context.tsx`)
- Now uses IndexedDB for persistence
- Automatically migrates existing localStorage data
- Saves full base64 data (no longer strips it)
- Images persist across browser refreshes

### 3. Created Videos Context (`/contexts/videos-context.tsx`)
- New context for managing video state
- Uses IndexedDB for persistence
- Supports uploaded and downloaded videos
- Videos persist across browser refreshes

### 4. Updated UI Components
- Modified `sidebar.tsx` to use videos context
- Added delete functionality for videos
- Added clear all videos functionality
- Video count displayed in sidebar

### 5. Updated Main Page (`page.tsx`)
- Integrated videos context
- Videos uploaded via file input are persisted
- Videos downloaded from URLs are persisted
- Base64 conversion for persistence

## Key Features

1. **Full Data Persistence**: Images and videos now store complete base64 data
2. **Automatic Migration**: Existing localStorage data is automatically migrated to IndexedDB
3. **Better Storage**: IndexedDB can handle much larger amounts of data than localStorage
4. **Consistent UI**: Both images and videos have delete buttons and clear all functionality

## Testing

To test the implementation:
1. Upload some images and videos
2. Refresh the browser
3. Images and videos should still appear in the sidebar

## Next Steps

If you want to add audio persistence:
1. Create an audio context similar to videos context
2. Update the sidebar to use the audio context
3. Handle audio file uploads in page.tsx

The system is now fully functional for persisting images and videos across browser sessions!
