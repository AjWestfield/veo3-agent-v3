# Additional Fixes Implemented - July 16, 2025

## 1. Stop Button Abort Error Fix

**Issue**: Clicking the stop button caused an "AbortError: signal is aborted without reason" error.

**Root Cause**: The abort controller was being aborted without providing a reason parameter.

**Fix Applied**: 
- Updated `handleStop()` function to provide a proper DOMException with reason
- Changed from `abort()` to `abort(new DOMException('User cancelled the request', 'AbortError'))`

**File Modified**: `/app/page.tsx`

## 2. Web Search Enhancements

**Issues**: 
- Source citations were missing website favicons
- Related images might not display correctly due to different API response formats

**Fixes Applied**:

### Source Favicons:
- Added favicon display for each source using Google's favicon service
- Favicon URL: `https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=${domain}&sz=32`
- Includes fallback handling if favicon fails to load

### Image Display:
- Enhanced image URL extraction to handle multiple formats from Perplexity API
- Checks for: `image.url`, `image.image_url`, and `image.src`
- Added image alt text support from API response
- Added image index number overlay in top-right corner
- Added debug logging to track images received from API

**File Modified**: `/components/web-search-results.tsx`

## 3. New Chat Button Fix

**Issue**: Users had to click the "New Chat" button twice to start a new chat.

**Root Cause**: The `createNewSession()` function already sets the current session ID, but the handler was also calling `switchToSession()`, causing state management conflicts.

**Fix Applied**: 
- Removed redundant `switchToSession()` call from the `onNewChat` handler
- Now only calls `createNewSession()` which handles everything internally

**File Modified**: `/app/page.tsx`

## Testing

All fixes have been applied and the app is ready for testing:

1. **Stop Button**: Should cancel requests without throwing errors
2. **Web Search**: 
   - Sources should show favicons next to domain names
   - Related images should display correctly if returned by Perplexity
3. **New Chat**: Should create a new chat with a single click

## Debug Information

Added debug logging to track image responses from Perplexity API:
- Logs number of images received
- Shows structure of first image for debugging

Check console logs when performing web searches to see image data structure.
