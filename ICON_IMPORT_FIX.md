# Icon Import Errors Fixed - July 16, 2025

## Issue
The web search results component was failing with import errors for heroicons:
- `FileTextIcon` is not exported
- `ExternalLinkIcon` is not exported
- `ImageIcon` is not exported

This caused a runtime error: "Element type is invalid: expected a string..."

## Root Cause
The icon names being imported didn't match the actual names in `@heroicons/react/24/outline` v2.

## Solution
Updated the imports in `/components/web-search-results.tsx`:

### Before:
```typescript
import { ExternalLinkIcon, FileTextIcon, ImageIcon, QuestionMarkCircleIcon } from "@heroicons/react/24/outline"
```

### After:
```typescript
import { ArrowTopRightOnSquareIcon, DocumentTextIcon, PhotoIcon, QuestionMarkCircleIcon } from "@heroicons/react/24/outline"
```

### Icon Replacements:
- `FileTextIcon` → `DocumentTextIcon`
- `ExternalLinkIcon` → `ArrowTopRightOnSquareIcon`
- `ImageIcon` → `PhotoIcon`
- `QuestionMarkCircleIcon` → `QuestionMarkCircleIcon` (unchanged)

## Files Modified
- `/components/web-search-results.tsx` - Fixed all icon imports and references

## Testing
The app now runs successfully on port 3007 without any import errors. Web search functionality is working correctly.
