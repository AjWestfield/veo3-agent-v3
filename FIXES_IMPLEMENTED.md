# Fixes Implemented - July 16, 2025

## 1. Perplexity API Error Fix

**Issue**: The web search tool was failing with a 400 error because it was using unsupported parameters.

**Root Cause**: The API request included `web_search_options` and `search_context_size` which are not supported by Perplexity's API.

**Fix Applied**: 
- Removed the unsupported `web_search_options` object
- Removed `search_mode` parameter
- Simplified the payload to only include supported parameters
- Added detailed logging for debugging

**File Modified**: `/app/api/search-web/route.ts`

## 2. Send Button UI Updates

**Issue**: 
- Send button was black instead of white
- No stop functionality during message processing

**Fixes Applied**:
- Changed button background from black to white
- Updated text color to black for better contrast
- Added stop icon that shows when loading/processing
- Implemented stop functionality with abort controller
- Button now acts as stop button when processing

**Files Modified**: `/app/page.tsx`

### Key Changes:
1. **Visual Updates**:
   - Background: `bg-white` (was `bg-black`)
   - Text: `text-black` (was `text-white`)
   - Hover: `hover:bg-gray-200`
   - Disabled: `disabled:bg-gray-300 disabled:text-gray-500`
   - Dark mode support maintained

2. **Stop Functionality**:
   - Added `abortControllerRef` to track active requests
   - Created `handleStop()` function to cancel ongoing requests
   - Button shows stop icon (square) when loading
   - Button type changes from "submit" to "button" when loading
   - Click handler switches between submit and stop based on state

## 3. Heroicons Import Error Fix

**Issue**: Web search results component was failing with "Element type is invalid" error due to incorrect icon imports.

**Root Cause**: Icon names didn't match heroicons v2 exports.

**Fix Applied**:
- Changed `FileTextIcon` to `DocumentTextIcon`
- Changed `ExternalLinkIcon` to `ArrowTopRightOnSquareIcon`
- Changed `ImageIcon` to `PhotoIcon`
- Updated all references throughout the component

**File Modified**: `/components/web-search-results.tsx`

## Testing

The app is now running on port 3007. All fixes have been tested and verified:

1. ✅ **Web Search**: Working correctly without API errors
2. ✅ **Stop Button**: Properly cancels ongoing requests
3. ✅ **Icon Display**: All icons rendering correctly in search results

## Summary

All three issues have been successfully resolved. The web search functionality is now fully operational with proper error handling, improved UI, and correct icon display.
