# Video Download Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

### 1. Duplicate Video Processing
**Problem**: When pasting a YouTube URL, the video was being processed twice:
- Once in the `handlePaste` event handler
- Again in the `handleSendMessage` function

**Root Cause**: The paste handler prevented the paste but then cleared the message. If the user re-typed or the URL somehow remained, it would be processed again on send.

### 2. Video Not Displaying in UI
**Problem**: Downloaded videos were not appearing in the chat input or sidebar.

**Root Cause**: In `handleSendMessage` (line 674), the code was incorrectly handling the return value from `downloadVideoFromUrl`:
```typescript
// WRONG - pushing the wrapper object
const downloadedVideo = await downloadVideoFromUrl(url)
if (downloadedVideo) {
  downloadedVideos.push(downloadedVideo)
}
```

The function returns `{ file: FileWithPreview | null, ... }` but the code was pushing the entire object instead of just the `file` property.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Duplicate Processing

**In `handleSendMessage`**:
- Added check to only process video URLs if:
  - Not already downloading (`!isDownloadingVideo`)
  - No files are already attached (`filesWithPreviews.length === 0`)
  
This prevents duplicate processing when URLs are pasted and then sent.

### 2. Fixed Video Display Issue

**In `handleSendMessage`**:
```typescript
// CORRECT - extract the file property
const result = await downloadVideoFromUrl(url)
if (result.file) {
  downloadedVideos.push(result.file)
}
```

### 3. Improved User Experience

**In `handlePaste`**:
- Removed automatic clearing of the message input
- Let users decide what to do after paste is intercepted
- This prevents confusion when paste is blocked

### 4. Added Debug Logging

Added comprehensive logging throughout the flow:
- `[Paste Handler]` - Tracks paste event processing
- `[Send Handler]` - Tracks send message processing  
- `[Video Download Utils]` - Tracks API calls
- `[Sidebar]` - Tracks video additions

## How It Works Now

1. **When you paste a YouTube URL**:
   - Paste event is intercepted
   - Video starts downloading immediately
   - URL is NOT cleared from input (user choice)
   - Video is added to files and sidebar when complete

2. **When you send the message**:
   - Checks if already downloading or files attached
   - Skips video processing if so
   - Prevents duplicate downloads

3. **Video Display**:
   - Downloaded videos appear in chat input area
   - Videos are added to sidebar "Videos" tab
   - Platform is correctly detected and stored

## Testing Instructions

1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open browser console (F12) 
3. Paste a YouTube URL
4. Watch console logs - should see:
   - `[Paste Handler] Downloading video from: <url>`
   - `[Video Download Utils]` messages
   - `[Paste Handler] Video downloaded successfully`
   - `[Paste Handler] Adding video to sidebar`
5. Should NOT see `[Send Handler]` messages unless you clear input and re-type URL

## Verification

Run the test script:
```bash
node test-video-download-flow.js
```

This will:
- Test the API directly
- Provide manual testing instructions
- Help verify the fixes are working

## Next Steps

If issues persist:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify yt-dlp is installed: `which yt-dlp`
3. Check API logs in terminal running `npm run dev`
4. Try different YouTube URLs (some may be restricted)
