IMPORTANT FIRST STEP - Subject Identification:
1. Identify any people, animals, or key subjects in the video
2. If public figures/celebrities are present, name them and their known work
3. Describe physical characteristics in detail (height, build, hair, clothing, accessories)
4. Note any distinctive features or mannerisms

CRITICAL: Your prompt must be so detailed that it reverse-engineers the video completely.`;

  if (isAutoDetect) {
    return `${baseInstructions}

Then, determine the total duration of the video. If the video is longer than 8 seconds, automatically divide it into multiple 8-second clips.

For videos longer than 8 seconds:
- Calculate how many 8-second clips are needed (e.g., 24-second video = 3 clips)
- Each clip should be exactly 8 seconds (except possibly the last one)
- Provide a separate VEO 3 prompt for EACH 8-second segment
- Ensure continuity between clips while maintaining individual clip integrity

Start your response with: "VEO 3 AUTO-DETECTED CLIPS ANALYSIS:"
Then indicate: "Video Duration: [XX seconds] | Number of 8-second clips: [N]"

${clipAnalysisTemplate}

If the video is 8 seconds or shorter, provide just ONE clip analysis.
Each section header must be in CAPS followed by a colon. Include ALL sections even if some have minimal content.`;
  } else if (numClips && numClips > 1) {
    return `${baseInstructions}

Analyze this video and detect ${numClips} distinct clips/scenes (approximately 8 seconds each). For EACH clip, provide a separate VEO 3 prompt using the comprehensive template.

Start your response with: "VEO 3 MULTI-CLIP ANALYSIS:"

${clipAnalysisTemplate}

Repeat this exact structure for each of the ${numClips} clips. Each section header must be in CAPS followed by a colon.`;
  } else {
    return `${baseInstructions}

Analyze this video and provide a VEO 3 prompt that captures EVERY detail needed for recreation.

Start your response with: "VEO 3 PROMPT:"

${clipAnalysisTemplate}

IMPORTANT: Your analysis must be so thorough that someone could recreate this exact video without having seen the original.`;
