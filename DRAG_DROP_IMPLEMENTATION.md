# Drag and Drop File Upload - Implementation Complete

## Summary
The chat input component already has full drag and drop functionality implemented! The feature was already in the code but needed minor syntax fixes.

## Features Implemented:
1. ✅ **Drag Enter/Over** - Visual feedback when dragging files over the chat input
2. ✅ **Drag Leave** - Removes visual feedback when dragging away
3. ✅ **Drop** - Processes dropped files (images, videos, audio)
4. ✅ **Visual Indicator** - Blue overlay with "Drop files here" message
5. ✅ **Multi-file Support** - Can drop multiple files at once

## How It Works:
- Drag any image, video, or audio file over the chat input area
- The area will highlight with a blue overlay and show "Drop files here"
- Drop the files to upload them
- Files will appear as thumbnails above the text input
- Click thumbnails to preview in fullscreen modal
- Click the X button on thumbnails to remove files

## Technical Details:
- Event handlers: `handleDragEnter`, `handleDragOver`, `handleDragLeave`, `handleDrop`
- State management: `isDragOver` state for visual feedback
- File processing: Same `processFiles` function used by the file picker
- Supports: images (with thumbnails), videos (with frame preview), audio files

## Testing:
1. Open the application at http://localhost:3001
2. Drag any supported file from your file explorer
3. Hover over the chat input area
4. You should see the blue "Drop files here" overlay
5. Drop the file to upload it

The drag and drop functionality is now fully operational!
