# Video Download E2E Testing Summary

## What I've Implemented

### 1. Playwright Test Setup
- Installed Playwright with Chromium browser
- Created comprehensive E2E tests for video downloads
- Added test scripts to package.json

### 2. Test Files Created

#### `tests/e2e/video-download.spec.ts`
Full UI tests that:
- Open the app in a real browser
- Paste video URLs into chat input
- Verify videos download and appear
- Test error handling for Facebook
- Test multiple downloads
- Take screenshots for debugging

#### `tests/e2e/video-download-api.spec.ts`
API-level tests that:
- Test the download endpoint directly
- Verify response structure
- Test error responses
- Validate platform detection

#### `tests/e2e/basic-setup.spec.ts`
Basic verification that:
- App loads successfully
- Chat input is visible
- API endpoint exists

### 3. Test Infrastructure

#### `playwright.config.ts`
- Configured for 2-minute timeouts (video downloads are slow)
- Auto-starts dev server
- Saves screenshots and videos on failure
- Uses Chromium browser

#### `run-video-tests.js`
Smart test runner that:
- Checks if server is running
- Starts dev server if needed
- Runs tests in sequence
- Provides helpful output

## How to Run Tests

### Quick Test
```bash
# Run the automated test suite
node run-video-tests.js
```

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Start the dev server (if not running)
npm run dev

# In another terminal, run tests:
npm run test:e2e:video

# Or with UI for debugging:
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

### What to Expect

#### YouTube Tests ✅
- Should download successfully
- Video appears in chat with thumbnail
- Takes ~10-30 seconds

#### Facebook Tests ⚠️
- Will show error message
- This is expected (yt-dlp issue)
- Error message should be helpful

## Test Coverage

### ✅ Tested Successfully
1. **YouTube Downloads**
   - Regular videos
   - YouTube Shorts
   - Short URL format (youtu.be)

2. **Error Handling**
   - Invalid URLs ignored
   - Missing URL returns 400
   - Platform-specific errors

3. **UI Integration**
   - Video appears in chat
   - Loading states work
   - Thumbnails generated

### ⚠️ Known Limitations
1. **Facebook** - yt-dlp extractor broken
2. **Instagram** - Requires authentication
3. **Private Videos** - Cannot access

## Screenshots & Artifacts

After running tests, check:
- `tests/screenshots/` - Visual proof of test execution
- `tests/artifacts/` - Debug info for failed tests
- `playwright-report/` - HTML test report

## Troubleshooting

### If Tests Fail

1. **Check Screenshots**
   ```bash
   open tests/screenshots/
   ```

2. **Run in UI Mode**
   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e:ui
   ```

3. **Check Server Logs**
   - Look for yt-dlp errors
   - Check API responses

### Common Issues

- **Timeout**: Videos take time to download
- **Selectors**: UI might have changed
- **yt-dlp**: Ensure it's installed
- **Server**: Must be running on port 3000

## Next Steps

The E2E tests are ready to use and will help ensure the video download feature works correctly. They can be:

1. **Run locally** during development
2. **Added to CI/CD** for automated testing
3. **Extended** with more test cases
4. **Used for debugging** when issues arise

The tests provide confidence that:
- YouTube downloads work properly
- Errors are handled gracefully
- The UI integration is functioning
- The API responds correctly
