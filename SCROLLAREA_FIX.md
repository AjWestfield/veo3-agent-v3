# ScrollArea and Sheet Infinite Loop Fix

## Issue
The application was experiencing a "Maximum update depth exceeded" error immediately when loading. This was caused by Radix UI components' ref composition causing infinite render loops in React.

## Error Details
```
Error: Maximum update depth exceeded. This can happen when a component repeatedly calls setState inside componentWillUpdate or componentDidUpdate. React limits the number of nested updates to prevent infinite loops.
```

The error originated from `@radix-ui/react-compose-refs` which is used by both ScrollArea and Sheet components.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created ScrollAreaSafe Component
Created a new component at `components/ui/scroll-area-safe.tsx` that:
- Uses a simple div with overflow-auto instead of Radix UI's ScrollArea
- Includes custom scrollbar styling using Tailwind CSS
- Avoids the ref composition issues that cause infinite loops

### 2. Created SheetWrapper Component  
Created a new component at `components/ui/sheet-safe.tsx` that:
- Provides Sheet/Dialog functionality without Radix UI
- Uses simple React state management for open/close
- Implements overlay and content positioning manually
- Avoids complex ref forwarding that causes issues

### 3. Updated Components
Modified the following files to use the safe alternatives:
- `components/ui/sidebar.tsx` - Replaced ScrollArea with ScrollAreaSafe
- `components/multi-image-result.tsx` - Replaced ScrollArea with ScrollAreaSafe
- `components/multi-image-edit-modal.tsx` - Replaced ScrollArea with ScrollAreaSafe
- `components/settings.tsx` - Replaced Sheet with SheetWrapper

## Technical Details
The Radix UI ScrollArea and Sheet components use complex ref forwarding and composition that can sometimes cause React to enter an infinite update loop. Our safe components provide the same functionality without the complexity that causes these issues.

## Testing
After implementing this fix:
1. Stop the development server: `Ctrl+C`
2. Clear browser cache: `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux)
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
4. The infinite loop error should no longer occur
