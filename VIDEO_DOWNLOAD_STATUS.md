# Video Download Status Report

## Current Status (as of 2025-07-17)

### ✅ YouTube - WORKING
- Successfully downloading videos
- Tested with multiple URLs including YouTube Shorts
- Downloads complete with proper metadata (title, size, duration)
- Example successful download: "Me at the zoo" (0.75 MB)

### ❌ Facebook - NOT WORKING
- **Root Cause**: yt-dlp's Facebook extractor is broken
- Facebook has changed their page structure, preventing yt-dlp from parsing video data
- Error: "Cannot parse data" - this is a known yt-dlp issue, not our implementation
- **Solution**: Wait for yt-dlp updates to fix their Facebook extractor

## Implementation Details

### What was done:
1. **Enhanced yt-dlp configurations** - Added platform-specific settings for YouTube and Facebook
2. **Retry logic** - Implemented fallback strategies with cookie support
3. **Improved error handling** - Clear, user-friendly error messages for each platform
4. **Better platform detection** - Automatically identifies video platform from URL

### Key Features:
- Platform-specific download options
- Automatic format selection (best quality MP4)
- Size limit enforcement (1GB max)
- Temporary file cleanup
- Base64 encoding for client delivery

## Recommendations

3. **Keep yt-dlp updated**: Run `npm update yt-dlp-exec` periodically
4. **Monitor yt-dlp releases**: Check for Facebook extractor fixes
